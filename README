This is intended to be a simple remote shell script runner.

what it does:

* rsyncs your current directory to a remote machine
* runs a shell command of your choice
* locks other machines from being able to use the same machine at the same time

What I want it to do:

* say which task fails
* say which hosts are in use and which are locked during the run


Example: 

setup = "source ~/.profile; rvm use ree-1.8.7-2010.02@casebook; bundle install;"

Dir["features/**/*.feature"]

Runner.run do |config|
  config.remote_path = "~/workspace/remote/#{`hostname`.strip}"
  config.local_path = Dir.getwd
  config.hosts = ["elizabeth", "bedford"]
  config.tasks = [
    "#{setup} bundle exec spec spec/models/api/",
    "#{setup} bundle exec spec spec/models/api/"
  ]
end
